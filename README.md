Eindopdracht Front-End voor Designers


Welcome to the Read Me of the final assignment Front-End for Designers.

This project is made to retrieve data from an external API about movies. Once the movies are loaded thet will be displayed in a card layout. Each card shows a simple plot about the movie and with the button "Lees meer" you will see the full plot.

There's also a heart shaped like button. When clicking this button the heart will change to red so you can see what movies you've liked. 

By pressing the left or right arrow on your keyboard you will switch to the next movie card.
